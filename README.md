# Data-Programming-in-Python-Group-Project

This repository is for our group project for the University of Iowa Data Programming in Python class. We are combining Minneapolis crime data with Minneapolis weather data for the years 2015 - 2017. Our plan is to experiment with different machine learning models using the Python programming language to derive incites from this data.
